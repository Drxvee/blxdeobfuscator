# blxdeobfuscator

A simple python code obfuscator made for fun 

How does it work:
1. Edit config.json as you like
2. Put your code in in.py
3. Launch main.py
4. The obfuscated code is in out.py

 "suicideondeobf" - Python file clears itself on code changes
 "rudeantideobf" - Python opens explorer infinitely on code changes
 "msgs" - Python prints 'Do not even try' on code changes
